## Editing

Before you add missing fixes to the database, make sure to [create an issue](https://github.com/InfiniteFlightAirportEditing/Navigation/issues/new).
Remember that our database uses the decimal coordinates system. If your source isn't using this system, use an online converter like [this one](http://www.latlong.net/degrees-minutes-seconds-to-decimal-degrees).

Afterwards, open the _fixes.json_ file in your text/code editor. As you may have recognised, the fixes are in alphabetical order.
Search for the fix (using command/ctrl + F) and make sure it isn't already there. 
If not, you can add it. Copy the code snippet below and paste it in the right spot (alphabetical order) of the file.

```json
  {
    "Latitude": 0.0,
    "Name": "00000",
    "Longitude": -10.0
  },
```

Replace the three fields with accurate data.
Repeat these steps to add other fixes.

Once you're finished, go ahead and save the files.
